Let's take a look at the extinction laws that we can use to de-redden the young stars in  Cep Ob3b.  The three main laws are the @rieke_interstellar_1985, the @cardelli_relationship_1989, and @allen_anomalous_2014 [link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014ApJ...786..113A).  The spectra used in @allen_anomalous_2014 were recently calssified visually and many that were used as K5 background giants have been retyped.  We will explore here how reasonable the @allen_anomolous_2014 law is.

We will make use of the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package.  Note, we are defining the python engine in the R setup chunk. 

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
#devtools::install_github("rstudio/reticulate")
library(reticulate)
use_python("/anaconda3/bin/python")
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
