Let's take a look at the extinction laws that we can use to de-redden the young stars in  Cep Ob3b.  The three main laws are the Reike & Labowsky 1985 law, the Cardelli, Clayton and Mathis, and [Allen et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014ApJ...786..113A).  The Allen et al. 2014 law was derived from misclassified spectral types.

We will make use of the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package.  Note, we are defining the python engine in the R setup chunk. 

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
#devtools::install_github("rstudio/reticulate")
library(reticulate)
use_python("/anaconda3/bin/python")
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Let's quickly check which version of python we are using.  I shoud be usng 3.6.x.
```{python}
import sys as sys
print(sys.version)
```
